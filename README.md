# D3-Challenge

For this assignment, I used the D3 techniques I learned in class to create a scatter plot with circle elements.

The scatter plot compares the percent of people in poverty to the percent lacking healthcare in each state.  Each circle represents a different state.

## Analysis
- From the [scatter plot](https://knorman123.github.io/D3-Challenge/D3_data_journalism/), we can see that there is a positive correlation between the poverty rate and the percent of people lacking healthcare.
- If you hover over each circle, you can see the exact data for that state.
